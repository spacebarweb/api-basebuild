# api-basebuild

## Synopsis
> This is a sample API setup

## Motivation
> Created this build because as a developer new to creating an API I had difficulty finding material to create one myself.
> This is just to help others out there in the same shoes as I was :)

## Installation
+ If you don't have composer install from https://getcomposer.org/
+ Run "composer install" in the root of the directory to get the required vendors
+ Tweak config/config.ini file with your preferred db connection params
+ Tweak index.php to pull data from your database instead
